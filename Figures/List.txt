Figure 1: Heatmap depicting the resistome profile of 5653 strains from 19 different STs belonging to seven phylogroups. Frequency of each of these genes at the ST level was calculated using the formula (presence in no. of strains of ST/total no. of strains in ST) × 100 and plotted using matplotlib module. 

Figure 2: Heatmap depicting the virulome profile (adhesins, invasins, iron uptake etc) of 5653 strains from 19 different STs belonging to seven phylogroups. Frequency of each of these genes at the ST level was calculated using the formula (presence in no. of strains of ST/total no. of strains in ST) × 100.

Figure 3: Heatmap depicting the prevalence of genes linked with secretion systems in 5653 strains from 19 different STs belonging to seven phylogroups. Frequency of each of these genes at the ST level was calculated using the formula (presence in no. of strains of ST/total no. of strains in ST) × 100.

Figure 4: A. Barplot depicting the prevalence of Class 1 integrons among the 19 STs considered under this study. B. Sunburst plot depicting the moderate and high prevalence of transposons among the 19 STs. 

Figure 5: Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot (with the top 2 PCoA axes) showing the clustering of
genomes from different STs. A nested screen plot within the image depicts the proportion of
variance explained by each of the principal components (PCs).

Figure 6: Cluster map depicting the prevalence of validated important features from the RF model among the 19 STs considered under this study. The frequency of each of the proteins at the ST level was calculated using the formula (presence in no. of genomes of ST/total no. of genomes in ST)  100. Feature names are represented on the y axis and the ST lineage on the x axis.
